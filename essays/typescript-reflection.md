## Learning Typescript

So far, this was my first ever experience with typescript and it has been pretty okay. I am used to learning languages like Python and JavaScript, and I always felt that learning a new language was like reviewing. The basic concepts and fundamentals still transferred between languages with the only difference being that some of the "rules" are changed like in how certain things are structured. But in general felt like reviewing something that was already learned with some new properties thrown in.

## Software Engineering Perspective
From what I have learned from doing the basics of Typescript, it feels like a pretty solid language for software engineering. Since it builds off Javascript, I can see how it makes bigger projects easier to organize and to keep things like classes and objects more consistent. 

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
