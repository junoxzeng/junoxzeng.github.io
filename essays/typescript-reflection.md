## Learning Typescript

So far, this was my first ever experience with typescript and it has been pretty okay. I am used to learning languages like Python and JavaScript, and I always felt that learning a new language was like reviewing. The basic concepts and fundamentals still transferred between languages with the only difference being that some of the "rules" are changed like in how certain things are structured. But in general felt like reviewing something that was already learned with some new properties thrown in.

## Software Engineering Perspective
From what I have learned from doing the basics of Typescript, it feels like a pretty solid language for software engineering. Since it builds off Javascript, I can see how it makes bigger projects easier to organize and to keep things like classes and objects more consistent. It building off Javascript also helps the language since it has all the advantages that Javascript has in the perspective of Software Engineering while also maintaining the more nuances features that Typescript offers like the explicit/implicit data values thats maybe a little more focused depending on the type of software that is being worked on.

## Practice WODS and Style of Learning
Reflecting on the athletic software engineering side of things, especially the practice WODS, has been definetely helpful. The WODS are pretty new to me as I am used to the standard model of homework. It has been pretty fun to time myself and do these practices to see how I have improved through each attempt though I have noticed that even if I give myself time between each attempt, I still do it way faster because I have the general idea on how to solve it. This style of learning of just repeated practice has been pretty enjoyable, it is something new to me that I never really done in previous classes before where we spend more time just cranking out practice and problems in class rather than just listen to a lecture. While I can see how some people might take some time getting used to it. I believe that this style of learning by practicing and just getting into it is the best style of learning for me. I often get a sort of performance and knowledge anxiety where I want to prepare everything so its perfect before I dive into doing it, like all the technical details. However, I have found that I learn way better just going for it instead of waiting so everything it perfectly lined up or when everything is perfectly setup.
