## The Beginning of the "End"
The presence of AI (artificial intelligence) has been a monumental and explosive one. I rememebr the day around 5 years ago when ChatGPT first was released into the public and the massive impact it had. One of which was especially prevalent was it's impact of the education sector. I remember whole schools and colleges had to start developing measures in place to counteract AI and its ability. Even now, it is still an ongoing battle. One specific field that is majorly impacted is the software engineering field. The emergence of AI in the field of coding as a tool has become an awkward situation for the community. Students and beginners are able to get a splurge of code without learning anything about how to actually do it themselves.

## Personal Experience
Software Engineering (ICS 314) provided many opportunities to use AI especially since it was so hands on with coding.
