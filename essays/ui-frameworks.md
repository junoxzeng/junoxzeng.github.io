## Learning Frameworks

Learning a to build a UI framework felt like learning a new language. I spent hours remembering new class names, layer behavior, and adjusting margins so that it looks perfect for what I envisioned. While HTML defined the structure and CSS handled presentation, writing all those styles manually felt more like a chore. Things like making buttons, containers, and nav bars were simple but time consuming especially if I had to do it every time I started a new project. Without a consistent framework, it felt like everyone did things a little bit differently and what someone else learned to do, I learned a completely different way of doing it. This is where Bootstrap came in.

## The Power of Bootstrap
Bootstrap or more specifically Bootstrap 5 is what I learned. It came with many features and also a consistent framework everyone had to follow and that made it easier to work together. Its vast variety of custom classes allowed me to create pages without having to manually do them myself as there was already the basic framework for it.

## Personal Experience with Bootstrap 5
When I first used Bootstrap 5 for my ICS 314 web development projects. I felt the power of it immediately. Remembering what specific classes that came with Bootstrap 5 was a little bit of a chore but it allowed me to design my pages so much faster. I began to enjoy it as it made developing web pages not feel as tedious. For example, I rebuilt a website inspired by the Island Snow website, I used Bootstrap's custom navbars that came along with it. The same thing if I had done in basic HTML and CSS would've taken me at least several more hours. At first, learning Bootstrap felt like a extra chore since I learned HTML and CSS already. However, over time, that time investment repaid itself several times over as it made making websites so much more efficient and faster.
