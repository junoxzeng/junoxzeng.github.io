## Smart Questions and Smart Engineers
When thinking of software engineering, the ability to code and problem solve is paramount to the success of a career. However, how do newcomers develop that skill? The ability to ask a well formed question is just as valuable as writing good code because it not only saves the time by being clear and efficient but will also help the community as a whole. The quality of a question is often linked to the quality of response that it will receive and this especially holds true in a community like Stack Overflow who is volunteer based and can have a wide variety of skill levels and personalities.

## Simple, Direct, Fast
One example of a smart question that was asked by a user on StackOverflow was "Can I use comments inside a JSON  file? If so, How?" The question is very direct and gets to the problem. It specifies the specific language, JSON, and clearly lets you the reader know what the user wants to ask. It was especially relevant as well towards the public as a whole since during the time it was published which was almost 17 years ago, there wasn't the convenience of being able to lookup the answer which made learning a new coding language especially difficult. This in turn allowed the question to become more universal as anyone learning JSON might have this question.

```
No.

JSON is data-only. If you include a comment, then it must be data too.

You could have a designated data element called "_comment" (or something) that should be ignored by apps that use the JSON data.

You would probably be better having the comment in the processes that generates/receives the JSON, as they are supposed to know what the JSON data will be in advance, or at least the structure of it.

```
By being so direct and concise, the user received responses that were direct, clear, and concise. The top response which is shown above explained the problem simply and also offered a solution or alternative that could be used. This was one of the earliest examples of a smart question being asked being especially relevant as it is still one of the most viewed questions on stack overflow till this day.

## How to get Ignored

While there is no such thing as a "dumb" question, there is a way to ask questions that will be unproductive and frustrating for others to answer. In this example, the user asked the question shown down below.

```
This question is analogous to How to keep Visual Studio autocomplete from overwriting the next word, but targeted at Visual Studio Code instead of Visual Studio.

When a completion suggestion is selected from the list, it is inserted, but all characters from the word after the cursor are deleted. (So, nothing happens if there is a whitespace after the cursor. But if autocompletion is triggered while the cursor is placed at the beginning of a word, said word will be deleted).

Is there a way to disable this deletion behavior and get it to add the selected suggestion without deleting text to the right of the caret?
```
While this is still a relatively great question to ask and it is asked in a great way, there is still some missing elements that keep it from being a great question. It firstly lacked some detail such as the specific VS code version and language that they were having problems with. Second of all is that the question is too broad, is it only on certain languages they are having with? Is it a question about IntelliSense generally or is it a problem with VS Code? As a result, the responses that they received were more general and not as focused. The top upvoted response could only help by suggesting they go into the settings and to turn off the default behavior and that they might need to check certain languages whether the default is changed which makes the response to the question more broad. The insufficient detail leads to a reponse that isn't as clear cut of a solution to the question at hand

## The Importance of Questions
Smart questions are essential to software engineers. Learning to ask a smart question not only allows you and the recipient to save time by asking clear cut questions, but it also allows clear cut responses. In the field of software engineering, the stereotype is no longer the solo developer working from their basement. It is now a big group effort, collaborations between teams to facilitate efficient communication to get the job done fast and nicely. Smart question create ways to benefit not only the person asking the question but also ways for the people who come after who might also have the same question. Smart questions isn't only just a essential skill for software engineers, it is a essential skill for any person for any profession who needs to not only work with others but also learn from others. Being able to ask smart questions allows people to get the best responses.


## Insights
From comparing these two questions that are considered smart and not as smart, but still a good question. I have realized that by being able to ask a smart question, the better question that I ask, the better answer that I get. By clarifying my questions, getting straight to the point, and by giving enough context, I will be able to get the same quality response in return. By putting in the effort to ask that smart question, I can show that I care enough which will in turn invite the same respect to the effort shown. Smart questions not only help myself but also others. A good smart question is often one that many others experience and would likely ask as well. By starting with quality, I not only help myself but also others.
