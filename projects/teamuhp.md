## What is TeamUHp?

TeamUHp is a collaborative web platform designed to connect people around project-based work. Users can create project listings that include key details such as required skills, number of collaborators needed, deadlines, and compensation. After logging in, users are presented with a streamlined dashboard where they can browse projects seeking collaborators or easily switch to view and manage their own listings. 

# TeamUHP Role

My main role in TeamUHp was working on the backend of the site. I was primarily responsible for implementing core functionality such as user authentication, including login and signup flows, as well as handling database interactions and ensuring data integrity across the application. Much of my work focused on making sure these systems were reliable, and integrated smoothly with the frontend so that users could interact with the platform without issues.

This was my first time being part of a group coding project, and it gave me a small glimpse of what software engineering in the real world is like. Working with other people, dealing with shared code, and figuring things out together felt very different from working on projects alone, but it was a really valuable experience.
