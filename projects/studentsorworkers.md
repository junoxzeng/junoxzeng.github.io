This project focused on the debate around whether college athletes should be viewed mainly as students or as workers. College sports bring in a huge amount of money, yet the athletes themselves often receive little beyond scholarships. This raised the question of whether it is fair to treat them as amateurs when their time, effort, and performance closely resemble a full-time job. I worked on this project for a KRS, handling all of the research and writing on my own.

The goal of this paper was to explore both sides of the argument. Some people believe college athletes are students first and that scholarships and education are enough compensation. Others argue that college athletes function more like employees, since they follow strict schedules, generate revenue, and take on physical and mental risks without direct pay. This topic sits in the middle of education, labor rights, and sports, which makes it a complicated and interesting issue to analyze.

Overall, this project helped me better understand how blurred the line is between being a student and being a worker for college athletes. It also showed how legal changes and recent court cases are starting to challenge the NCAA’s long-standing rules. Through this assignment, I improved my research and writing skills and gained a clearer perspective on how college sports operate behind the scenes.
